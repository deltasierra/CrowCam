Notes on creating a new live stream
-----------------------------------

Below are the settings I use when creating a new live stream. Sometimes
YouTube glitches badly enough that I must create the live stream again from
scratch. As long as the script is working as expected, it should be OK for me
to completely delete my YouTube channel's main live stream and start over with
these settings. The script then updates the stream ingestion secret key
automatically and begins streaming correctly. This is what I did to correct
issue #42.

Here are my personal settings:



Video Description
-----------------

Here is a permanent link to the most current live stream: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqPZGFtBau8rm7wnScxdA3g/live
--- 
Live view of backyard crows and squirrels, Seattle, Washington. The video feed is only live from sunrise to sunset each day, since crows and squirrels are diurnal. The most common species we see at this feeder are the Northwestern crow and the Eastern gray squirrel, and recently, occasional visits by a Steller's jay.

Use the video's "scrub bar" control, to scroll backwards into the video feed, to find recent visits by the critters. Note: The live stream may stop and restart at certain times of day, limiting how far back in the timeline that you can view. If the live stream seems to stop during the day, if it doesn't automatically restart itself after a moment, then try clicking on the permanent link above, and then try refreshing the page.

We have installed a new feeder system to keep the seagulls out. We used to put food in bowls for the crows (they like puppy kibble), but after a while, the seagulls got the hang of it, and would eat all the crows' food before they could get any. The new feeder takes care of this. The feeder is a modification of an off-the-shelf "seesaw" counter-weighted design, which was originally designed for smaller chirpy birds: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G17E7Y - The seesaw closes the food openings if anything too heavy lands on the perch. The feeder was originally designed to keep squirrels out of the birdseed, but crows and squirrels weigh about the same, and both of those species are welcome here. So we modified the feeder by replacing the chirpy bird perch with a platform for the crows and squirrels to land on, then added more weight to the seesaw's counterweight. Now the feeder's landing platform will accept the weight of crows and squirrels, while rejecting the weight of seagulls. This kept the seagulls away for several months, until one of them figured out it could land on the roof and bend over really far, and occasionally got a kibble or two. So we added a plexiglass extension to the roof to thwart it. Example of seagull frustration here: https://bit.ly/2KSayzW

There is some custom script code to control and maintain this camera feed, and it is open source on GitHub: https://github.com/tfabris/CrowCam

My personal YouTube settings which differ from YouTube defaults

Change Thumbnail: (Video thumbnail is my own saved image, made in Adobe
Spark online, by logging in with my Adobe ID account credentials)

Category: Pets & Animals

Stream Optimizations: Normal Latency

Activate the "Make archive unlisted when complete" feature. This setting is
unchecked by default, and can be found in both the basic settings screen and
the advanced settings screen.

Crows, Squirrels, Animals, Live, Cam, Webcam, Birds, Birdwatching

- How to change the tags? Sometimes it is hard to find the screen.
- Press ADVANCED SETTINGS.
- Press BASIC INFO.
- I know the above seems unintuitive (advanced then basic) but it worked for
  me, at a time when I couldn't find the tags field.
- If you take the string above with the commas, and paste the whole string
  into the tags field, with the commas, it works.
