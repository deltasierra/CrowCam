# This value points to the parent YouTube live stream that these scripts are
# controlling. It must be the live stream's main parent URL, not the address
# of an individual video within the channel. For instance, it must not be an
# archived video, or a link to a particular day's live stream. You can tell
# whether it is the correct link by looking at the the style of the URL:
#
#   Right:    https://www.youtube.com/channel/xyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyz/live
#   Wrong:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyzxyzxyzxyz
#
# This value is used when checking if the stream is working, and it is used
# when ensuring that the stream's DVR functionality stays working.
#
# Update this value to point to your live stream.
#
youTubeUrl="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqPZGFtBau8rm7wnScxdA3g/live"


# Title of videos within the stream, to clean up at regular intervals. Only
# videos in the "My Uploads" section of the stream, with titles which match
# this string exactly, will be deleted.
#
# Note: Will also be used for checking that it's OK to work with the stream
# key of this stream name, as part of the fix for GitHub issue #27.
#
# Update this value to be the exact same title as your live stream.
#
titleToDelete="CrowCam"


# The number of days in the past that we will let old videos live before
# cleaning them up. For example, if this number is 5, and a video named
# $titleToDelete was made 4 days ago, it will not be deleted, but a
# $titleToDelete video made 5 days ago will be deleted.
#
# Set this to the number of days you wish to keep old videos before deletion.
#
dateBufferDays=8


# Desired visibility/privacy of the live stream. Most live streams are set to
# public, but you may have reasons for wanting to keep it unlisted or private.
# Because YouTube intermittently glitches and clobbers this value, the script
# will attempt to maintain this and keep it at the correct setting. Valid
# values are "private", "public", or "unlisted".
#
# Set this to the desired visibility/privacy of this video stream, either 
# "private", "public", or "unlisted".
#
desiredStreamVisibility="public"

# Camera location for using in a Google Search. Can be a zip code, a city name,
# or something else which might result in a Google search that returns the
# correct sunrise or sunset time. Special bonus: If you leave the location
# blank (""), Google will just search on the word "Sunrise" or "Sunset" and
# automatically attempt to determine your location, based on where the query is
# originating from. Maybe this will work for your particular situation, feel
# free to experiment with leaving it blank. The code simply performs a Google
# search with a search string where the word "Sunrise" or "Sunset" precedes
# this location string. Examples: 
#   location="98125"        Google search will be "Sunrise 98125" etc.
#   location="Seattle,WA"   Google search will be "Sunrise Seattle,WA" etc.
#   location="Bangladesh"   Google search will be "Sunset Bangladesh" etc.
#   location=""             Google search will be "Sunset" etc.
# Note: Must not have any spaces in the location string.
#
# Set this value to either blank ("") or your location. No spaces.
#
location=""


# Difference, in minutes, that you want to perform the startup and shutdown of
# the video stream during any given day. A value of zero would mean exactly on
# time, negative numbers are preceding sunrise or sunset, and positive numbers
# are after sunrise or sunset. For instance, setting startServiceOffset=0
# would mean that the stream will start exactly at sunrise, setting
# startServiceOffset=-30 would mean that the stream will start 30 minutes
# before sunrise, and stopServiceOffset=60 would mean that the stream will
# stop 60 minutes after sunset.
#
# Set these to your desired start and stop offset values.
# 
startServiceOffset=-15
stopServiceOffset=15


# Maximum length, in seconds, that a video is allowed to get, before the code
# will attempt to split the video sometime during the middle of the day. This
# addresses GitHub issues #34 and #44.
#
# Problems can occur with the video archives if we try to record a livestream
# which lasts too long in a given day. For instance, the maximum length of any
# YouTube video seems to be about 12 hours (actually, it seems to be more like
# 11:55 in practice), and so if we livestream for longer than that, the video
# archive of that day will be truncated. Also, there is a "processing" phase
# on YouTube, where the livestream is being converted into an archive video,
# and the "processing" takes a long time if the video file is too long. So
# pretty much every day, splitting the video in the middle of the day is
# useful to do.
#
# The script will bounce the video stream (splitting the video archive file
# into multiple manageable segments) based on the length of the current video
# segment, the midpoint of the expected day's stream (the approximate midday)
# and the value you enter below. If the current recording segment of the day's
# video stream has either already (or is expected to) exceed the max length
# you set, then the script will bounce the stream, splitting the video archive
# at an appropriate length.
#
# Set this variable to be the desired maximum video length, between about
# 4 hours and 11:55 hours.
#
# Recommend setting to a value which is slightly less than the winter solstice
# daylight hours in your region, and/or slightly less than half of the summer
# solstice daylight hours. For instance, if the shortest day of your year is
# going to be 8.5 hours, and the longest day of your year is going to be about
# 16 hours, then set this to something like 8 hours. You can also set it for
# shorter lengths if you prefer the day's video to be split up into even
# smaller segments. Some possible values could be:
#    maxVideoLengthSeconds=42900    (11 hours and 55 minutes, max recommended)
#    maxVideoLengthSeconds=39600    (11 hours)
#    maxVideoLengthSeconds=28800    (8 hours)
#    maxVideoLengthSeconds=25200    (7 hours)
#    maxVideoLengthSeconds=21600    (6 hours)
#    maxVideoLengthSeconds=14400    (4 hours)
maxVideoLengthSeconds=25200


# The webApiRootUrl is the base URL of the API of the Synology NAS we are
# accessing, from the point of view of the script running on the NAS itself

# Name of the Synology Surveillance Station service that we are checking, to
# see if it is up. If the service is not up, it will be assumed that it has
# been deliberately turned off on the NAS, and these scripts will skip the
# steps which are not applicable if the service is shut down. To test this
# behavior, you can stop and start this service on the Synology NAS either by
# going to the Package Center GUI and disabling the "Surveillance Station"
# package temporarily, or by connecting to the synology shell via SSH, and
# issuing commands such as:
#      sudo synoservicectl --stop pkgctl-SurveillanceStation
#      sudo synoservicectl --start pkgctl-SurveillanceStation
